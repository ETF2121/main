### Learning goals

By the end of the lab you will...

-   engineer features based on episode scripts
-   train a model
-   interpret model coefficients
-   make predictions
-   evaluate model performance on training and testing data

### Section 3: Installing R and RStudio

#### Installing R

R is a powerful statistical programming language used for data analysis and visualization. Follow these steps to install R on your computer:

1.  **Download R:**

    -   Go to the CRAN R Project website.

    -   Click on the link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

    -   For Windows: Click on "Download R for Windows" and then click on "base". Click on the download link to get the installer.

    -   For macOS: Click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X". Choose the appropriate file for your macOS version and download the installer.

    -   For Linux: Follow the instructions provided for your specific distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.).

2.  **Install R:**

    -   **Windows:** Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation prompts. Accept the default settings unless you have specific requirements.

    -   **macOS:** Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation prompts.

    -   **Linux:** Use the terminal and follow the instructions from the CRAN website to add the R repository and install R via your package manager.

#### Installing RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes coding in R easier and more efficient. Follow these steps to install RStudio:

1.  **Download RStudio:**

    -   Go to the RStudio website.

    -   Click on the "Download" button under RStudio Desktop.

    -   Choose the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2.  **Install RStudio:**

    -   **Windows:** Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation prompts.

    -   **macOS:** Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag the RStudio icon to your Applications folder.

    -   **Linux:** Open the terminal and follow the instructions provided on the RStudio website to install RStudio via your package manager or download and install the .deb or .rpm package.

3.  **Launch RStudio:**

    -   After installation, open RStudio. It should automatically detect your R installation. If it doesn't, you may need to manually configure the path to the R executable in the RStudio settings.

By completing these steps, you will have both R and RStudio installed on your computer, ready for use in data analysis and visualization tasks.

### Section 4: Getting Started with R and RStudio

Now that you have installed R and RStudio, it's time to get familiar with the environment and start coding.

#### 4.1 Exploring the RStudio Interface

RStudio provides a user-friendly interface that integrates various tools for working with R. Here's a quick overview of the main components:

1.  **Source Pane:**

    -   This is where you write and edit your R scripts. You can open multiple tabs to work on different scripts simultaneously.

2.  **Console Pane:**

    -   The console pane is where you can directly enter R commands and see the output immediately.

3.  **Environment/History Pane:**

    -   The Environment tab shows all the objects (data, variables, functions) currently in your workspace.

    -   The History tab keeps a record of all the commands you've entered in the console.

4.  **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer Pane:**

    -   The Files tab lets you navigate your file system.

    -   The Plots tab displays plots generated by your R code.

    -   The Packages tab allows you to manage R packages.

    -   The Help tab provides access to R documentation and help files.

    -   The Viewer tab can display web content or documents.
