### Section 4: Getting Started with R and RStudio

Now that you have installed R and RStudio, it's time to get familiar with the environment and start coding.

#### 4.1 Exploring the RStudio Interface

RStudio provides a user-friendly interface that integrates various tools for working with R. Here's a quick overview of the main components:

    -   This is where you write and edit your R scripts. You can open multiple tabs to work on different scripts simultaneously.

2.  **Console Pane:**

    -   The console pane is where you can directly enter R commands and see the output immediately.

3.  **Environment/History Pane:**

    -   The Environment tab shows all the objects (data, variables, functions) currently in your workspace.

    -   The History tab keeps a record of all the commands you've entered in the console.

4.  **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer Pane:**

    -   The Files tab lets you navigate your file system.

    -   The Plots tab displays plots generated by your R code.

    -   The Packages tab allows you to manage R packages.

    -   The Help tab provides access to R documentation and help files.

    -   The Viewer tab can display web content or documents.

#### 4.2 Running R Code

To run R code in RStudio, you can either type commands directly into the console or write scripts in the source pane. Here's how to run code in RStudio:

1.  **Running Commands in the Console:**

    -   Type an R command in the console and press `Enter` to execute it.

    -   The output will be displayed below the command.

    -   For example, you can type `2 + 3` in the console and press `Enter` to see the result.

2.  **Writing Scripts:**

    -   To write longer scripts or save your code for later use, open a new script file by clicking on `File > New File > R Script`.

#### Exercises

1.  **Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers:** using R/Rstudio

    -   5 \* 3 - 7
    -   (5 \* 3) - 7
    -   5 \* (3 - 7)

Discuss the results, is it as what you expected?

2.  **Create a Vector:** using R/Rstudio

    -   Create a vector named `numbers` with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    -   Calculate the sum of the vector using the `sum()` function.
    -   Calculate the mean of the vector using the `mean()` function.

3.  **Create a Data Frame:** using R/Rstudio

    -   Create a data frame named `students` with the following columns: `name`, `age`, `gender`.
    -   Add the following data to the data frame:
        -   Name: Alice, Age

Phew....feel overwhelm?

```         
😓
```

The whole exercise is just to make sure you successfully installed all necessary software in your pc. Once you get it install, everything will become easier later on. Having trouble? Please consult your tutor asap.
