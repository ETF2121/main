This approach leverages data-driven or fact-based methods, often considered more objective than other decision-making alternatives. \n\nThe tools of business analytics support decision-making by:\n\n* Generating insights from data\n* Enhancing our forecasting abilities for more accurate planning\n* Quantifying risks\n* Providing better alternatives through analysis and optimization\n\n## Types of Business Analytics\n\n-   **Descriptive Analytics:** What happened?\n-   **Predictive Analytics:** What will happen?\n-   **Prescriptive Analytics:** What should we do?\n\n## Descriptive Analytics\n\n-   Descriptive analytics is the interpretation of **historical data** to better understand changes that have occurred in a business.\n-   It is the most basic form of analytics and is used to understand what has happened in the past.\n-   Descriptive analytics is used to understand the current state of a business and to track key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n## Predictive Analytics\n\n-   Predictive analytics is the use of **data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques** to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.\n-   It is used to forecast future trends, behaviors, and events.    \n-   Predictive analytics uses many techniques from data mining, statistics, modeling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to analyze current data to make predictions about the future.\n\n## Prescriptive Analytics\n\n-   Prescriptive analytics is the **final stage of business analytics**.\n-   It involves using **optimization and simulation algorithms** to advise on possible outcomes and answer the question, \"What should we do?\"\n-   Prescriptive analytics is used to make decisions based on the insights generated by descriptive and predictive analytics.\n\n## Data Types\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-width: 10\n%%| fig-height: 8\nflowchart LR\n  A[Data] --> B(Qualitative)\n  A --> C(Quantitative)\n  B --> D[Nominal]\n  B --> E[Ordinal]\n  C --> F[Discrete]\n  C --> G[Continous]\n```\n\n\n## Quiz\n\n1.
