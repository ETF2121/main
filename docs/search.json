Each session will include various activities and assignments designed to enhance your skills.\nAttendance and active participation in both lectures and tutorials are expected. Attending lectures and tutorials in person will provide the best learning experience. Some lectures will feature application exercises and periodic activities to foster a supportive learning community. These activities will be brief and enjoyable, aimed at strengthening connections among classmates throughout the semester.\n\nExams\nFinal exam. The exam will be held during the exam period, and it will be a closed-book exam with 5 pieces of A4 paper (10 pages) of handwritten/typed notes allowed. It is a supervised exam, and you will not be allowed to access the internet.\n\n\nLate work submission policy\nAssignment deadlines are set to facilitate your progression through the course content and to enable timely feedback from the teaching team.

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

    "text": "Introduction to R Language\n\nWhat is R?\nR is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.\n\n\nWhy R?\n\nR is open-source and free\nR is a powerful tool for data analysis\nR has a large and active community\nR has a large number of packages for data analysis\nR is a programming language and can be used for automating data analysis tasks\nR is a great tool for reproducible research\n\n\n\nRStudio\nRsudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.\n\n\nBasic of R\n\nR as a Calculator\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nR Objects\nIn R, everything is an object. These objects serve as containers for various types of data. Whether you’re dealing with a single number, a character string (like a word), or a complex structure like the output of a plot or a statistical analysis summary, it’s all represented as an object.\nCreating Objects:\nTo create an object, you simply give it a name. For instance\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this example, an object is created called x and it is assigned the value 5. The &lt;- is the assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right to the object on the left. You can also use = to assign values to objects, but it’s considered bad practice.\nViewing Objects:\nTo view the value of an object, you simply type the name of the object and press enter. For instance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nR keeps track of all objects in the current workspace during the session. You can see all the objects in the current workspace by typing ls() in the console.\nOpearations with Objects:\nYou can perform operations with objects. For instance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nObjects names:\nObject names can contain letters, numbers, periods, and underscores. However, they can only starts with letters or underscore and nothing else. They are case-sensitive, so x and X are different objects. They cannot start with a number or a period. If you would like to insist to have numbers or period as the first character, you can use backticks to define the object name. It is called nonsyntactic names. For instance, you can define the following:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercises:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nCreate an object called a and assign the value 10 to it.\nCreate an object called b and assign the value 20 to it.\n\nCreate an object called star and assign the value a + b to it.\nView the value of star.\nWhich of the following is not the syntactic name for an object?\n\nx\nX\n1x\nx1\nx.y\nx_y\n\n\n\n\nData Types\nR has several data types. The most common data types are:\n\nNumeric (double)\n\n\nrepresents eal numbers (e.g., 3.14, 0.0001, 1000.0).\ncan be positive or negative.\ncan be in scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e-5).\nused for continuous data like measurements, weights, heights, etc.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\nrepresents text data (e.g., “hello”, “world”, “R is fun”).\nmust be enclosed in quotes.\nused for categorical data (e.g., “High School”, “Primary School”, “University”).\n\n\nLogical (boolean)\n\n\nrepresents binary data (e.g., TRUE or FALSE).\nused for logical operations.\n\n\nInteger\n\n\nrepresents whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 1000).\ncan be positive or negative.\nused for counting data like number of students, number of cars, etc.\nsometimes you will see it ends with L (e.g., 1L, 2L, 3L, 1000L). This is to indicate that the number is an integer.\n\n\nFactors\n\n\nrepresents categorical data (e.g., “High School”, “Primary School”, “University”).\nused for categorical data.\n\n\nComplex\n\n\nrepresents complex numbers (e.g., 1 + 2i, 3 + 4i, 5 + 6i).\nused for complex data like electrical engineering, physics, etc.\n\nHowever, we seldom deal with complex data types. We will focus on the first four data types.\nExercises:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat is the data type of 3.14?\nWhat is the data type of \"hello\"?\nWhat is the data type of TRUE?\nWhat is the data type of 1L?\nWhat is the data type of factor(\"High School\")?\nWhat is the data type of 1 + 2i?\nWhat is the data type of \"1\"?\n\nNote: You can check your answers using typeof() function.\n\n\nFunctions\nA function is a block of code that performs a specific task. R has a large number of in-built functions and also allows users to define their own functions. We will learn more about how to create functions in the coming weeks. But so far, we will use some of the in-built functions. Anything that starts with ( and end with ) is a function.\nExercises:\nDefine which one is a function below:\n\nmean()\nmedian\nsd()\nvar()\nsum[]\n\n\n\nVectors\n\n\nData Frames\n\n\nPackages\nR packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones.\nExercises:\n\nInstall tidyverse package. Explain what do you observe from the console.\nLoad the tidyverse package. Explain what do you observe from the console.\nInstall palmerpenguins package. Explain what do you observe from the console.\nLoad the palmerpenguins package. Explain what do you observe from the console.\nLoad the lmer package. Explain what do you observe from the console."

That is your final project.\nThe goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing. The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.\nChoose the data based on your group’s interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\nAll analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the presentation).\n\nLogistics\nYou will work on the project with your lab groups.\nThe four primary deliverables for the final project are\n\nA written, reproducible report detailing your analysis\nA GitHub repository corresponding to your report\nSlides + a video presentation\nFormal peer review on another team’s project"

The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report.

The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

These objects serve as containers for various types of data. Whether you’re dealing with a single number, a character string (like a word), or a complex structure like the output of a plot or a statistical analysis summary, it’s all represented as an object.\nCreating Objects:\nTo create an object, you simply give it a name. For instance\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this example, an object is created called x and it is assigned the value 5. The &lt;- is the assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right to the object on the left. You can also use = to assign values to objects, but it’s considered bad practice.\nViewing Objects:\nTo view the value of an object, you simply type the name of the object and press enter. For instance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nR keeps track of all objects in the current workspace during the session. You can see all the objects in the current workspace by typing ls() in the console.\nOpearations with Objects:\nYou can perform operations with objects. For instance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nObjects names:\nObject names can contain letters, numbers, periods, and underscores. However, they can only starts with letters or underscore and nothing else. They are case-sensitive, so x and X are different objects. They cannot start with a number or a period. If you would like to insist to have numbers or period as the first character, you can use backticks to define the object name. It is called nonsyntactic names. For instance, you can define the following:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercises:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nCreate an object called a and assign the value 10 to it.\nCreate an object called b and assign the value 20 to it.\n\nCreate an object called star and assign the value a + b to it.\nView the value of star.\nWhich of the following is not the syntactic name for an object?\n\nx\nX\n1x\nx1\nx.y\nx_y\n\n\n\n\nData Types\nR has several data types. The most common data types are:\n\nNumeric (double)\n\n\nrepresents eal numbers (e.g., 3.14, 0.0001, 1000.0).\ncan be positive or negative.\ncan be in scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e-5).\nused for continuous data like measurements, weights, heights, etc.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\nrepresents text data (e.g., “hello”, “world”, “R is fun”).\nmust be enclosed in quotes.\nused for categorical data (e.g., “High School”, “Primary School”, “University”).\n\n\nLogical (boolean)\n\n\nrepresents binary data (e.g., TRUE or FALSE).\nused for logical operations.\n\n\nInteger\n\n\nrepresents whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 1000).\ncan be positive or negative.\nused for counting data like number of students, number of cars, etc.\nsometimes you will see it ends with L (e.g., 1L, 2L, 3L, 1000L). This is to indicate that the number is an integer.\n\n\nFactors\n\n\nrepresents categorical data (e.g., “High School”, “Primary School”, “University”).\nused for categorical data.\n\n\nComplex\n\n\nrepresents complex numbers (e.g., 1 + 2i, 3 + 4i, 5 + 6i).\nused for complex data like electrical engineering, physics, etc.\n\nHowever, we seldom deal with complex data types. We will focus on the first four data types.\nExercises:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat is the data type of 3.14?\nWhat is the data type of \"hello\"?\nWhat is the data type of TRUE?\nWhat is the data type of 1L?\nWhat is the data type of factor(\"High School\")?\nWhat is the data type of 1 + 2i?\nWhat is the data type of \"1\"?\n\nNote: You can check your answers using typeof() function.\n\n\nFunctions\nA function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
