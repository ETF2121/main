## What is Business Analytics?

Business analytics is the scientific process of **transforming data into insights** to facilitate better decision-making. This approach leverages data-driven or fact-based methods, often considered more objective than other decision-making alternatives. 

The tools of business analytics support decision-making by:

* Generating insights from data
* Enhancing our forecasting abilities for more accurate planning
* Quantifying risks
* Providing better alternatives through analysis and optimization

## Types of Business Analytics

-   **Descriptive Analytics:** What happened?
-   **Predictive Analytics:** What will happen?
-   **Prescriptive Analytics:** What should we do?

## Descriptive Analytics

-   Descriptive analytics is the interpretation of **historical data** to better understand changes that have occurred in a business.
-   It is the most basic form of analytics and is used to understand what has happened in the past.
-   Descriptive analytics is used to understand the current state of a business and to track key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Predictive Analytics

-   Predictive analytics is the use of **data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques** to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.
-   It is used to forecast future trends, behaviors, and events.    
-   Predictive analytics uses many techniques from data mining, statistics, modeling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to analyze current data to make predictions about the future.

## Prescriptive Analytics

-   Prescriptive analytics is the **final stage of business analytics**.
-   It involves using **optimization and simulation algorithms** to advise on possible outcomes and answer the question, "What should we do?"
-   Prescriptive analytics is used to make decisions based on the insights generated by descriptive and predictive analytics.
