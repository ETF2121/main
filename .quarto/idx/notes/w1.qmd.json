This introductory document will guide you through the basics of Power BI and help you get started with creating your first report.\n\n### **What is Power BI?**\n\nPower BI is a suite of business analytics tools by Microsoft that includes software, services, and connectors. It transforms your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses.\n\n### **Getting Started**\n\n#### **1. Download and Install Power BI Desktop**\n\n-   Go to the [Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) and download the Power BI Desktop.\n\n-   Follow the installation instructions to install Power BI Desktop on your computer.\n\n#### **2. Open Power BI Desktop**\n\nOnce installed, open Power BI Desktop. You will see the following interface:\n\n![](https://s33046.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/power-bi-desktop-layout.png)\n\n#### **3. Connect to Data**\n\nTo start working with data, you need to connect Power BI to your data source. Here's how:\n\n-   Click on the \"Home\" tab.\n\n-   Click on the \"Get Data\" button.\n\n![](https://learn.microsoft.com/vi-vn/power-bi/connect-data/media/desktop-quickstart-connect-to-data/qs-connect-data_02.png)\n\n-   Select your data source from the list (e.g., Excel, SQL Server, Web, etc.).\n\n-   Follow the prompts to load your data into Power BI.\n\n#### **4. Transform Data with Power Query Editor**\n\nAfter loading your data, you might need to clean and transform it. Use Power Query Editor for this purpose:\n\n-   Click on the \"Home\" tab.\n\n-   Click on the \"Transform Data\" button.\n\n![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/media/desktop-query-overview/query-overview-transform.png)\n\nThe Power Query Editor will open, where you can clean and prepare your data.\n\n![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/media/power-query-ui/pqui-user-interface.png)\n\n#### **5. Create Visualizations**\n\nOnce your data is ready, you can start creating visualizations:\n\n-   Go back to the main Power BI Desktop window.\n\n-   In the \"Visualizations\" pane, select the type of visualization you want to create (e.g., bar chart, line chart, pie chart, etc.).\n\n-   Drag and drop fields from the \"Fields\" pane to the \"Values\", \"Axis\", \"Legend\", etc., in the \"Visualizations\" pane.\n\n![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/media/power-bi-report-add-visualizations-i/add-visual-1.png)\n\n#### **6. Build Reports**\n\nCombine multiple visualizations into a report:\n\n-   Use the \"Report\" view in Power BI Desktop.\n\n-   Arrange your visualizations on the canvas.\n\n-   Add titles, labels, and other elements to enhance your report.\n\n#### **7. Save and Publish Your Report**\n\n-   Click on the \"File\" tab.\n\n-   Select \"Save As\" to save your report locally.\n\n-   To share your report, click on the \"Publish\" button.\n\n![](https://learn.microsoft.com/vi-vn/power-bi/create-reports/media/desktop-upload-desktop-files/pbid_publish_publishbutton.png)\n\nFollow the prompts to publish your report to the Power BI service, where you can share it with others.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully created your first Power BI report. Power BI is a versatile tool with many advanced features, so continue exploring and experimenting to unlock its full potential. Happy data analyzing!\n\n## Section 2: Introduction to R Language\n\n### What is R?\n\nR is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.\n\n### Why R?\n\n-   R is open-source and free\n-   R is a powerful tool for data analysis\n-   R has a large and active community\n-   R has a large number of packages for data analysis\n-   R is a programming language and can be used for automating data analysis tasks\n-   R is a great tool for reproducible research\n\n### RStudio\n\nRsudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.\n\n### \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: callout-note\nLearning Objective:\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n## \n\n## Section 1: Introduction to Power BI\n\n**Welcome to Power BI!**\n\nPower BI is a powerful business analytics tool that enables you to visualize data, share insights, and make data-driven decisions.
