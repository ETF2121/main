Follow these steps to install R on your computer:\n\n1.  **Download R:**\n\n    -   Go to the CRAN R Project website.\n\n    -   Click on the link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n\n    -   For Windows: Click on \"Download R for Windows\" and then click on \"base\". Click on the download link to get the installer.\n\n    -   For macOS: Click on \"Download R for (Mac) OS X\". Choose the appropriate file for your macOS version and download the installer.\n\n    -   For Linux: Follow the instructions provided for your specific distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.).\n\n2.  **Install R:**\n\n    -   **Windows:** Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation prompts. Accept the default settings unless you have specific requirements.\n\n    -   **macOS:** Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation prompts.\n\n    -   **Linux:** Use the terminal and follow the instructions from the CRAN website to add the R repository and install R via your package manager.\n\n#### Installing RStudio\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes coding in R easier and more efficient. Follow these steps to install RStudio:\n\n1.  **Download RStudio:**\n\n    -   Go to the RStudio website.\n\n    -   Click on the \"Download\" button under RStudio Desktop.\n\n    -   Choose the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n\n2.  **Install RStudio:**\n\n    -   **Windows:** Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation prompts.\n\n    -   **macOS:** Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag the RStudio icon to your Applications folder.\n\n    -   **Linux:** Open the terminal and follow the instructions provided on the RStudio website to install RStudio via your package manager or download and install the .deb or .rpm package.\n\n3.  **Launch RStudio:**\n\n    -   After installation, open RStudio. It should automatically detect your R installation. If it doesn't, you may need to manually configure the path to the R executable in the RStudio settings.\n\nBy completing these steps, you will have both R and RStudio installed on your computer, ready for use in data analysis and visualization tasks.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Section 4: Getting Started with R and RStudio\n\nNow that you have installed R and RStudio, it's time to get familiar with the environment and start coding.\n\n#### 4.1 Exploring the RStudio Interface\n\nRStudio provides a user-friendly interface that integrates various tools for working with R. Here's a quick overview of the main components:\n\n1.  **Source Pane:**\n\n    -   This is where you write and edit your R scripts. You can open multiple tabs to work on different scripts simultaneously.\n\n2.  **Console Pane:**\n\n    -   The console pane is where you can directly enter R commands and see the output immediately.\n\n3.  **Environment/History Pane:**\n\n    -   The Environment tab shows all the objects (data, variables, functions) currently in your workspace.\n\n    -   The History tab keeps a record of all the commands you've entered in the console.\n\n4.  **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer Pane:**\n\n    -   The Files tab lets you navigate your file system.\n\n    -   The Plots tab displays plots generated by your R code.\n\n    -   The Packages tab allows you to manage R packages.\n\n    -   The Help tab provides access to R documentation and help files.\n\n    -   The Viewer tab can display web content or documents.\n\n#todo: insert video here\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn today's lab you will analyze data from the [schrute](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/) package to predict IMDB scores for episodes of The Office.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis is a different data source than the one we've used in class last week.\n:::\n\n### Learning goals\n\nBy the end of the lab you will...\n\n-   engineer features based on episode scripts\n-   train a model\n-   interpret model coefficients\n-   make predictions\n-   evaluate model performance on training and testing data\n\n### Section 3: Installing R and RStudio\n\n#### Installing R\n\nR is a powerful statistical programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
